<hr>

Troop 223 tries to offer at least once-monethly campouts to our scouts, in order for them to rapidly advance to the rank of 
First Class

  <hr>
  
  <p>

first class is the fourth rank in scouting, and it is the minimum rank that most scouts should try to achieve. this is the rank where  adult leaders will try to help the scouts advance, and where they will learn basic elements of conservation, survival skils, and 
responsibility that they will run into in thier everyday adult lives. 

  </p>

<p>

The next three ranks are <strong>Star</strong>, <strong>Life</strong>, and <strong>Eagle</strong>, and these the Scouts Must go for
on thier own. these are ranks that are highly saught after and mean a lot to achieve, especually Eagle, and are worth the time to    accomplish. Achieving these can be vital when getting jobs in many fields, espesually in the armed forces. That is why Troop 223 is such a good choice when looking for troops to join, because the skills and benifits achieved here can benifit Scouts both in the short term and the long run, leading to success and compitancy for Scouts in thier adult lives.

<h3>

But what about Camping?
  
</h3>

  <hr>

As previously stated, we try to go camping at least once a month. our goal is to get the scouts to a proficiant rank, while still having fun. The Troop goes to a variety of locations, including state parks, Private camp sites, and scout camps, and in addition we try to get the scouts aquainted to a variety of locations and conditions, including rain, snow, heat and PAIN!  All jokes aside though, we try to get the scouts as prepaired as possible while still having fun. some of our activities on trips include: rapelling, biking, hiking, canoeing, shooting and much, much, more!

<h3>Oath and Law</h3>

<hr>


The <strong>Scout Oath</strong> and <strong>Law</strong> are a set of morals and principles which we as scouts are required to live by on a daily basis and throughout our communities. these are the laws and rules which are fundamentle to scouting as a whole, and without them scouting would not be the organization it is today.
<br>
at every meeting we recite these, along with the pledge and outdoor code, to remind us to always be true to the fundamentals of scouting and to reinvigorate us with the <strong>Scout Spirit.</strong>
<hr>

  <p>
  <br>  
Congrats! you are now an official Boy Scout of America! The next thing you will need is a uniform and Scout Book to look the part.
  <br>
A Scout uniform is an integril part of being a Scout. The uniform shows not only your friends and family, but also the entire country that you are a Boy Scout of America.

A Scout uniform, which is also called a Class A, consists of four elements: Scout pants, a Scout Belt, a Scout shirt, and a Scout Necerchief.
You are expected to show up in full uniform at every meeting, raising and lowering of the Flag, and at many events to show Respect and to show the public that you are a Scout.
