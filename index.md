<hr>

Troop 223 tries to offer at least once-monethly campouts to our scouts, in order for them to rapidly advance to the rank of 
First Class

  <hr>
  
  <p>

first class is the fourth rank in scouting, and it is the minimum rank that most scouts should try to achieve. this is the rank where  adult leaders will try to help the scouts advance, and where they will learn basic elements of conservation, survival skils, and 
responsibility that they will run into in thier everyday adult lives. 

  </p>

<p>

The next three ranks are <strong>Star</strong>, <strong>Life</strong>, and <strong>Eagle</strong>, and these the Scouts Must go for
on thier own. these are ranks that are highly saught after and mean a lot to achieve, especually Eagle, and are worth the time to    achieve. Achieving these can be vital when getting jobs in many fields, and espesually the armed forces. That is why Troop 223 is such a good choice when looking for troops to join, because the skills and benifits achieved here can benifit Scouts both in the short term and the long run, leading to success and compitance for Scouts in thier adult lives.

<h3>

But what about Camping?
  
</h3>

  <hr>

As previously stated, we try to go camping at least once a month. our goal is to get the scouts to a ptoficiant rank, while still having fun. The Troop goes to a variety of locations, including state parks, Private camp sites, and scout camps, in order to get the scouts aquainted to a variety of locations and conditions, including rain, snow, heat and PAIN! All jokes aside, we try to get the scouts as prepaired as possible while still having fun. some of our activities on trips include: rapelling, biking, hiking, canoeing, shooting and much more,
