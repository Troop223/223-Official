<h1>Skymont</h1>

<hr>

<strong>Skymont</strong> was a blast. this trip was a Viking themed Camporee, with lots of activities, including axe and knife throwing, viking themed first aid scenarios, 
viking shield design, an obstacle coarse, and even a series of camp skits at the end (we did the best by far, obviously) overall a realy interesting experiance at Skymont Scout 
Ranch.
